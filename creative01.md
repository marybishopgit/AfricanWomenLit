📚 :books: In December, a few days before Christmas,Gary visited Grandma’s house. He asked the old woman for something quite weird for a boy of his age.
Granny listened to the boy and asked him to explain what he meant to make sure she understood it.
Her grandson, a ten-year-old boy arriving from the US, asked for such a simple thing. How could a boy raised in Washington D.C., a neighbor of Barack Obama, 
come up with an idea like that? Though Gary’s desire was a surprise for her, the boy conquered the old woman’s heart when he said to
Granny all he wanted was to hold a chicken and walk around with her.


“A chicken?” asked Grandma. “Walk around with a chicken?” Grandma wanted to make sure that she heard well. She left to her backyard, 
wandering and repeating “just a chicken.” Some tears almost appeared in her eyes. “About ten years ago, dozens of chickens ran around this backyard, my son.
I don’t have any chickens here now.” 

Gary’s face changed a bit. Clouds of frustration and even sadness covered his eyes. 
The boy had to pretend everything was fine because his visit couldn’t cause any inconvenience. 
His mother had told him a million times not to worry Granny. She was 95 years old, his mother’s grandmother.


“Granny, don’t worry, I thought you had a chicken here. Tell me stories of the times you had chickens in your backyard,” said the boy observing the tidy place. 
Everything was so clean and organized. 
“If your mother had told me that you wanted a chicken, I would get one for you,” said Grandma. 
The good aroma of coconut oil and fish all around the tiny blue house in the middle of the guava trees seemed to be part of the past.
The small skinny woman took care of everything, sweeping every corner as the wind through the windows brought the dust back again. 
The old woman cleaned again, talking to herself sometimes.  


After a while, the old woman took the courage to bother a neighbor. She put her head out of the window and called the woman with a gentle voice. 
“Katie, I need to borrow a chicken for a few minutes. Would you have one?” asked Grandma, trying to solve the situation. However, to her surprise, 
it wouldn’t be simple as she imagined. 


“I cannot say I didn’t listen to your grandson asking for a chicken. I have no chickens here. I think my sister has. Send George to tell her the situation.”


Grandma called her son George who never refused to do anything for the mother, but even George rejected the idea. Katie’s sister was a gossiper. 
The woman would tell everyone he wanted to steal her chicken. Uncle George was an honored man. 


“Such a fuss for a chicken!” George thought, going to the backyard, looking at the emptiness as if he were able to create a chicken for Gary. 
It could be a drawing or a paper chicken. The man didn’t dare to express what he was feeling. He looked around afraid someone could guess his thoughts. 
“It’s just a child’s desire,” George repeated. 


Time was going by. It was almost time to go back home. Gary’s mother was already talking about saying goodbye to Granny. 
The hope in the boy’s eyes was vanishing. The family would go back to the city in a couple of hours.
Maybe the chicken would still come. Gary tried to convince himself. 


Suddenly George flashed out of the house, running through the streets to borrow a chicken from Katie’s sister. 
Grandma breathed relieved. 
“A small chicken to walk around and pat it,” she said to herself. 
“That is all my son wants. It is so simple.  Maybe Gary has seen something like that in a book.”


For a moment, the house was silent; Gary observing his grandma; the old woman maintaining her faith. George would bring a chicken with him.
George came back. His hands were empty. The uncle went to the backyard. Grandma’s plan failed. Nobody needed to explain what happened.
Katie’s sister hadn’t accepted the idea of lending one of her chickens. 


“I’m feeling foolish. Who would believe someone would return a chicken? She thought I would keep it,” said George, feeling impotent and frustrated.
A whole family couldn’t find a chicken for a boy. George put his mind to work. Who could help them? 
Some minutes later, a light of hope invaded Uncle George’s heart.
His loud voice broke the house’s silence. “I know someone who can help us,” said the man, full of joy. 
“Mother, Uncle Denis has some chickens. I’m sure he will help us.” 

As Gary heard George’s words, the boy smiled, waiting for Grandma’s decision.
“George, you know your father’s brother isn’t a good person. 
My grandson has nothing to do with that man.” 
Grandma’s face was brave. Her voice was brave. 
“No, George, Denis is part of the past.”


Gary had never seen Granny speaking that way. 
Nobody has told him about Uncle Denis or why the old woman was mad at him. 

It had to do with the house. It all started with that house. The past Granny would like to forget was coming back to revisit her. The boy was sure it was his fault.  
That small blue house she lived in was one of Denis’ gifts when his brother abandoned Grandma to raise twelve children on her own. Uncle Denis gave 
her the house when she was facing a difficult situation.
With the new house, Grandma and his children were able to leave the island, get jobs and survive.   


The family, however, had to repay the house at least five times. Recently, Denis even took an old car from one of her children, saying they got a house. 
How could a man ask for more money fifty years later? 
“I don’t want Denis in this house?” George tried to say something. Grandma raised her hand, saying it was over. 
The conversation about the chicken was over. Even Gary understood it. 

The boy left the room. 
The house was silent. Who would contradict Granny? The old woman was furious. 
Uncle Denis’ name brought back a haunting past. 

It took more than one hour before a small voice came from the kitchen. It was Granny granting his son permission to visit Uncle Denis.
Gary smiled, jumped, and walked around, feeling anxious.  George flashed out of the house. 


It didn’t take long for him to return with a surprise.  Gary couldn’t believe it when he saw an old man coming in, wearing a brown suit, carrying his chicken. 
He raised his arm. “No, it won’t be easy like that.
You will have to catch it,” said the man, freeing the chicken around. 
The boy smiled, running and running. Grandma came to help. Uncle Denis held her hands. 
“It’s my grandson’s job, sister.”  Grandma didn’t have time to reply. The boy shouted. 
The chicken was in his arms, feeling good. Gary gave the chicken back 
to Uncle Denis and said “Thanks for coming, Grandpa.” 
Grandpa laughed so loud, his laugh filled the house like a fresh breeze.
Everybody laughed. Grandma hugged Gary and went to serve a delicious guava ice cream.
