Werewere Linking’s Elle sera de jasper et de corail uses stylistic innovation, challenging literary genres, thus playing with semantics, and morphology to propose a recovery of women’s voices through poetics, aesthetics and imagination. The text aligns with a broader movement for women empowerment, very present in the post-independence discourses across the African countries. The Cameroonian writer, through her multiple narrators, discusses women’s condition in her country but refuses to utilize Western epistemology, thus creating the neologism misovire, which literally means male hater. The misovire is main narrator. 


 Liking’s misovire uses the power of imagination to create, through the literary, a place which subverts the dichotomies by challenging paradigms which have determined our ways of thinking and conceptualizing. Though her explicit and clear message, the misovire demands gender equity through her textual liberation and experimentation. The author imagines a new world that blurs gender, racial, social, religious and national barriers. By placing at the center of her writing, the literary text itself, the writer mixes poetry, manifesto, novel and theatre while envisaging a space that permits freedom from patriarchal norms and colonial language. 
 
 
Werewere Liking defines her work as a chant- roman or a journal that contains nine sections or chapters. Each chapter deals with a different aspect of her project: the creation of a new humanity made of jasper and coral that overcomes the dichotomies created during the colonial period, either black/ white, or colonized/colonizer should be diluted, thus proposing other ways of thinking of theorizing. 


For the misovire, if our episteme has been tainted and our way of conceptualizing has been determined by a historical past, her proposal of using art to create what she calls a “new race.” In her poetics, structures and paradigms give place to colors blended almost in a synesthetic way. By transforming black and white in her bright light colors of jaspe and coral, the writer gradually gives place to a human being who inhabits the her created space which she calls Lunai.


While creating the new human and the place she inhabits, firstly, the writer experiments a textual liberation that disconnects her creative writing from western impositions. Breaking up with genre conventions in this work means not only a form to express the inability of approaching Africa through Western literary conventions, but also a strategy to create new discourses towards the continent. Within a tension which reflects the process of creation, through metalinguistics, Elle Sera de Jasper et de Coral attempts to explain itself, avoiding misinterpretations. By saying that her work is not autobiographical, she wants to avoid a western voyeuristic gaze. For the narrator, voyeurs need to gaze the private life of Lunai people through autobiographical art. She refuses to satisfy the outsider’s gaze.
