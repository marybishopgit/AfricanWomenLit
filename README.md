# African Women Literature

## Introduction

Colonial narratives and nationalist rhetoric in Africa have always associated
female sexuality with male desire and consumption, aberrance or perversion. While colonial discourses suggested that native women’s bodies should be tamed and possessed, nationalist narratives usually equated female bodies with land, nature, and spirituality. In different ways, hegemonic discourses appropriate the female body and sexuality to convey ideologies concerning the conquest of distant lands
or related to the dignity of a national community. 

<p>I examine how African
women writers’ representation of female desire counternarrates colonialist and nationalist
tales while disturbing gender conventions and defying social norms in African contexts. Works authored by African women often 
reveal female sexuality, while simultaneously subverting discourses that often define female bodies as sexual
objects or as spiritual entities— as the Mother Africa, a trope widespread in the speeches
of the Negritude movement.</p> 


<p>  
These works demonstrate not only the consequences of several policies and idologies on women’s bodies and minds but also reveal the exclusion of women’s voices from national and political affairs. By reinventing the literary in
order to forge a medium that is able to give sense to African women’s experience, women's works confront history and interrogate
the role of literature and the work of art.</p>

<p> 
Female bodies played an important role in defining the emptiness of colonized territories, and, in many colonial narratives, they were treated as synonymous with colonized land. One of the notions spread by European colonialism on the African continent was the myth of the “virgin land” that implies a blank territory in which colonized populations “cannot claim aboriginal territorial rights, and white male patrimony is violently assured as the sexual military insemination of an interior void” (McClintock 30). </p>


Metaphors of the colonized land as a woman ready to be deflowered have been part of colonial discourses around the globe. As a virgin, a woman is dispossessed of sexual desire and agency, becoming embedded in patriarchal tales of male sexual fantasy, the land also turns into a site for the male colonizer’s most perverted desires. As, McClintock affirms, women become 

> the earth to
be discovered, entered, named, inseminated, and above all, owned *(McClintock 31)*.


<p> 
During the nineteenth century sexuality and race functioned as prominent markers
of Otherness, setting parameters for what was normal and acceptable and what must be
regulated and brought into normality. In 1898 Joseph Conrad published <i>Heart of
Darkness</i>, a novel that would become a landmark for colonial studies. The novel emerged
from Conrad’s travels to what was the Belgian colony, Congo, which served as his main
inspiration. Though the novel has been acknowledged as a critique of King Leopold’s
abuses in Africa, Conrad also portrays a darkness of the continent and an African people
deprived of humanity, as the Nigerian writer Chinua Achebe remarked almost sixty years
later(Achebe 1977). </p>

<p>
To understand how these literary works undo stereotypes and reconstruct female subjectivity, it is crucial to see these narratives as a looking
glass where writers come to terms with their fragmented identities while giving their community tools to reinterpret women's experiences through
other lenses. </p>



## :rainbow: Werewere Liking


Werewere Linking’s Elle sera de jasper et de corail uses stylistic innovation, challenging literary genres, thus playing with semantics, and morphology to propose a recovery of women’s voices through poetics, aesthetics and imagination. The text aligns with a broader movement for women empowerment, very present in the post-independence discourses across the African countries. The Cameroonian writer, through her multiple narrators, discuss women’s situation in Africa but refuses to utilize Western epistemology, thus creating the neologism misovire, which literally means male hater. The misovire is main narrator. 


 Liking’s misovire uses the power of imagination to create, through the literary, a place which subverts the dichotomies by challenging paradigms which have determined our ways of thinking and conceptualizing. Though her explicit and clear message, the misovire demands gender equity through her textual liberation and experimentation. The author imagines a new world that blurs gender, racial, social, religious and national barriers. By placing at the center of her writing, the literary text itself, the writer mixes poetry, manifesto, novel and theatre while envisaging a space that permits freedom from patriarchal norms and colonial language. 
Werewere Liking defines her work as a chant- roman or a journal that contains nine sections or chapters. Each chapter deals with a different aspect of her project: the creation of a new humanity made of jasper and coral that overcomes the dichotomies created during the colonial period, either black/ white, or colonized/colonizer should be diluted, thus proposing other ways of thinking of theorizing. 


For the misovire, if our episteme has been tainted and our way of conceptualizing has been determined by a historical past, her proposal of using art to create what she calls a “new race.” In her poetics, structures and paradigms give place to colors blended almost in a synesthetic way. By transforming black and white in her bright light colors of jaspe and coral, the writer gradually gives place to a human being who inhabits the her created space which she calls Lunai.


While creating the new human and the place she inhabits, firstly, the writer experiments a textual liberation that disconnects her creative writing from western impositions. Breaking up with genre conventions in this work means not only a form to express the inability of approaching Africa through Western literary conventions, but also a strategy to create new discourses towards the continent. Within a tension which reflects the process of creation, through metalinguistics, Elle Sera de Jasper et de Coral attempts to explain itself, avoiding misinterpretations. By saying that her work is not autobiographical, she wants to avoid a western voyeuristic gaze. For the narrator, voyeurs need to gaze the private life of Lunai people through autobiographical art. She refuses to satisfy the outsider’s gaze.
