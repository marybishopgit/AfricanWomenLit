## Film and History

In *Film and the Construction of a New Past*, Robert Rosenstone affirms that films have been a medium to reinterpret the past, thus, historians should be more sympathetic to the visual media, as they open up other perspectives to approach the past. (Rosenstone,5) For him, African filmmakers look at historical fissures by challenging notions of linearity and objectivity or neutrality of historical research. What he calls *New History Film* gives room to a multiplicity of voices while bringing to light untold stories. Here, filmmaking utilizes many strategies and techniques to bring to the screen the multifaceted historical narratives, becoming a legitimate data to rethink and rewrite historical narratives. 


Rosenstone argues that some aspects of history which never had any space in children’s schoolbooks should appear in films, turning into an educational tool and an instrument of empowerment. These works often appear in communities where people want to make their voices heard, and are in “desperate need of historical connections -  postcolonial nations, long-established countries where political systems are in upheaval; societies recovering from totalitarian regimes or the horrors of the war; ethnic, political, social or sexual minorities involved in the search to recapture or create viable heritages.” (Rosenstone 1995:5)


By abandoning realism and its connection with the social order, and promoting new forms of representing historical narratives, *New History Films* diverge from traditional historical narratives in content and form and create new form of telling stories by “mixing genres, blurring the distinction between the documentary and the dramatic film.” (Rosenstone 1995:5)

A good example is Haile Gerima’s Sankofa, a narrative that intends to restore African descent past through an emphasis on subjectivity and self-representation by dismantling the idea of enslaved people as voiceless and passive commodities. Through visual media that also permits imagination and reinterpretation, Gerima brings to the center of his narrative a different historical perspective.

Also, Flame, Ingrid Sinclair’s film, a moving story that deals with the low status of women soldiers after the liberation of the country, focuses on women soldiers’ poverty and their exclusion from the spheres of power after the Independence of Zimbabwe. The process of liberation did not change women’s condition or minimize masculine privilege. Many debates on how women in the guerrillas were sexually abused and exploited during the war have been part and parcel of the historiography of women’s presence in the struggles of decolonization across the African continent.

Ousmane Sembéne, a Senegalese filmmaker, known as the father of African cinema, also deals with history rewriting, as an attempt to right a wrong and educate his people. Sembene started his career writing novels but thought the screen would reach a larger audience in Africa. Sembéne usually empowers female characters, deconstructs stereotypes, and defies patriarchal power, unveiling traditional structures that may contribute to women disempowerment. In Faat Kiné Sembene portrays a day of joy in the protagonist's life as her children celebrate the baccalaureate diploma. The flashbacks let us know what the protagonist had to go through until that celebration day. A mother who struggled to survive in a sexist environment where she had to face disrespect and violence, Sembéne's protagonist overcomes all obstacles, becoming a successful woman.
