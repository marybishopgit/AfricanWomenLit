# Filmmaking

## Intro

In *Film and the Construction of a New Past*, Robert Rosenstone affirms that films have been a medium to reinterpret the past. Historians should be more sympathetic to the visual media, as they open up other perspectives to approach the past. (Rosenstone,5) For him, African filmmakers look at historical fissures by challenging notions of linearity and objectivity or neutrality of historical research. What he calls *New History Film* gives room to a multiplicity of voices through other lenses while bringing to light untold stories. Here, filmmaking utilizes many strategies and techniques to bring to the screen the multifaceted historical narratives, becoming a legitimate data to rethink and rewrite historical narratives. 


Rosenstone argues that some aspects of history that never had any space in children’s schoolbooks should appear in films, turning into an educational tool and instrument of empowerment. These works often appear in communities where people want to make their voices heard, and are in “desperate need of historical connections – postcolonial nations, long-established countries where political systems are in upheaval; societies recovering from totalitarian regimes or the horrors of the war; ethnic, political, social or sexual minorities involved in the search to recapture or create viable heritages.” (Rosenstone 1995:5)


By abandoning realism’s connection with the social order, and promoting new forms of representing historical narratives, New History Films diverge from traditional historical in content and form. It creates new form of telling stories by “mixing genres, blurring the distinction betweenthe documentary and the dramatic film.” (Rosenstone 1995:5)

Haile Gerima’s Sankofa, a narrative that attempts to restore African descent past through an emphasis on subjectivity and self-representation, dismantles the idea enslaved people are voiceless and passive commodities. The filmmaker brings to the center of his narrative multiple voices by telling a new version of the historical narrative, through visual media that also permits imagination and reinterpretation. 


Flame, Ingrid Sinclair’s film, a moving story that deals with the low status of women soldiers after the liberation of the country, focuses on women soldiers’ poverty and their exclusion from the spheres of power after the Independence. In Zimbabwe, although ZANU(PF) officially supported gender equity, the country’s Independence did not change African women’s condition or minimized masculine privilege. Many debates on how women in the guerrillas were sexually abused and exploited during the war have been part and parcel of the historiography of women’s presence in the struggles of decolonization across the African continent.
